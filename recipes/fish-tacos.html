           least once a week because of how easy they are to make and how little clean up we have to do!</p>

            <li>1lb. Tilapia</li>
            <li>Slap Ya Mama seasoning</li>
            <li>Your favorite blackened seasoning</li>

        <h2>Let's Make It</h2>
         <ol>
          <li>First, Take your thawed Tilapia and place it on a cutting board or pan with foil. Lightly pat dry and 
          coat with thin film of olive oil.</li>
          <li>Next, take your blackened seasoning and liberally coat both sides of te fish. After you've gone over
          it with the blackened seasoning, go over it again with the Slap Ya Mama seasoning.</li>
          <li>Take a pan and place it on your cook top over medium high heat. add a little bit of olive oil to the 
            pan to coat it before adding your fish.</li>
          <li>While your fish is cooking,take your cole slaw bag and open it. place it in a suitable bowl and add the
            dressing to the mix. combine well and place in the fridge.</li>
          <li>Once the fish is done, scrape the bottom of the pan to remove the excess seasoning that stuck to the pan.
            add more olive oil to the pan and reduce your heat to medium. place your corn tortillas in the oil and cook
            for about a minute on one side, then about 30 seconds on the other side.</li>
          <li>now you're ready to assemble your tacos! lay out 3 or so tortillas on a plate and add one half of a 
            fish fillet to your tortillas. Then, add your slaw mixture to your tacos. Add your desired amount of 
            Jalapeno condiment to your taco and enjoy!
